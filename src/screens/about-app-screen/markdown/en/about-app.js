Monuments of Poltava is an interactive map featuring important monuments of the city with their description and gallery. We created it to promote public attention to the problem of a decline in the cultural legacy of our city.

This project was done completely by an initiative of volunteers and students, without any financial support. Now developing with *[#SavePoltava](https://savepoltava.city/)* support.

With our map you can:

-  find general information concerning monuments
-  use filters for improved search
-  browse a gallery with monuments pictured in several time periods
-  find out about destroyed monuments
-  find the closest monuments according to your location

We believe that Poltava will become more developed, tourist-friendly city by guarding and valuing historic and cultural heritage. If you are willing to contribute or support our team, please inquire by: [p.kopyl9@gmail.com](mailto:p.kopyl9@gmail.com).`;
